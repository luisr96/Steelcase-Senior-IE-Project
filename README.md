# Steelcase-Senior-IE-Project

Uses rectpack (https://github.com/secnot/rectpack) to compare the space efficiencies of floorloading vs. stacking packages.

The end goal of the project is to backtest enough historical data to statistically justify a company move from floorloading to stacking, and pallet improvement.
